myArmy User Documentation
=========================

What is myArmy?
---------------

myArmy is a tool that aids you in creating army lists for tabletop games.
You can build your lists with an easy-to-use graphical user interface, save and load
armies and also easier share them for others to comment and improve. This can be done
both online and offline, on your desktop PC or a mobile device.

Saving and Loading Armies
-------------------------

There are two ways to save your army list:

#. While editing your army, myArmy will create a link in your web browser's address
   bar. This link contains all of the information belonging to the army created - 
   you can for example bookmark it in your web browser, or copy and post it e.g. into 
   a web forum. If you re-call this link, the army with all selected options will be 
   restored and you may continue where you stopped before.

   If you mostly create army lists for a specific army it may be worthwhile to save a link 
   to this army type. Simply choose the army and then save a bookmark as described above, 
   without doing any choices between. 
   Using this bookmark you will always start with an empty army list of that army type.

#. When on the summary page, click "Download as file" and myArmy will offer you to save
   the current army as a file. This will save the link to this army and the summary in
   a simple text file. You can check the file contents, but do not change anything. 
   Otherwise it might be possible that the file cannot be loaded again.
   The army can be loaded in the main menu (the leftmost tab, where you choose your army
   type). Click the button next to "Open file" and choose the previously saved file.

Saving the page using the browser's "Save page" functionality is not recommended.

Mobile Devices
--------------

On small displays the handling slightly changes in order to preserve clarity. In the unit
overview only 1 slot (HQ, Elite, ...) will be displayed at any given time. You will see 
the other slots by using the menu buttons in the top.

Some devices have problems selecting the army list text - this is an issue in the 
devices/browsers, but we will nevertheless try to improve that in the future. 

Offline Use
-----------

In the main menu screen you will find a download button at the bottom. Using it will
provide a package of myArmy that you can open on your PC or other device. Extract it to any directory
and open "index.html" in your browser. From there on you can use myArmy offline just
as the online version.

If you use the online version, losing the internet connection will not prevent you
from using myArmy. But you won't be able to change the army type or the language while
offline.

Don't try to use the browser's "Save page" button - most likely the saved page will
not work.

Supported Browsers
------------------

As myArmy is a small project, we cannot guarantee that specific browsers are supported.
We try to provide stable functionality for these browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox (Desktop and Mobile)
- Google Chrome (Desktop and Mobile)
- Apple Safari (Desktop and Mobile)

As so often, Microsoft Internet Explorer is a special case. On the desktop, please do
not expect versions prior to 9.0 to work. Internet Explorer on Windows Phone doesn't
currently work due to Microsoft's philosophy on touch devices.

If there is something that doesn't work in your browser, feel free to report it
(though we might not be able to help).

Privacy
-------

myArmy isn't interested in your data. There are no ads and no external services are
being called. Indeed, we ourselves hate to be spied on throughout the internet, and 
will therefore never include anything that analyzes your personal usage data.
There is an exception though: Maybe we collect anonymous data that show us for example 
how many people use our services. There will never be efforts to identify a single user
and build a profile though.
