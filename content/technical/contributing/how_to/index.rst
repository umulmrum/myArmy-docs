How to Contribute
=================

Contributions are highly welcome. Please read this chapter as well as :doc:`/content/technical/contributing/best_practices/index`
to ensure that you contribute in a form that is ready to be included in the code base.

The decision upon what to merge into the code base is currently up to the project leader
in a "benevolent dictator" model - sorry about that. This might change in the future to
a more democratic procedure.

If you intend to contribute a larger extension, we recommend that you open an issue first,
so that your contribution can be discussed before you start working on it. This way we
can hopefully avoid that you do work in vain.
